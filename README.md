# 5G-exposed human skin cells do not respond with altered gene expression and methylation profiles

Due to the ever-increasing wirelessly transmitted data, the development of new transmission standards and higher frequencies in the 5G band is required. Despite basic biophysical considerations that argue against health effects, there is public concern about this technology. Because the skin penetration depth at these frequencies is only 1 mm or less, we exposed fibroblasts and keratinocytes to electromagnetic fields up to ten times the permissible limits, for 2 and 48 hours in a fully blinded experimental design. Sham-exposed cells served as negative, and UV-exposed cells as positive controls. Differences in gene expression and methylation due to exposure were small and not higher than expected by chance. These data strongly support the assessment that there is no evidence for exposure-induced damage to human skin cells.
